Revision history for Perl extension DBD::Solid.
0.12 Jul 26, 1999
    IMPORTANT
	* New maintainer...me

    Minor fixes:
        * Now links to Solid 3.0 libaries

0.11 Feb 24, 1998
    IMPORTANT fix: 
    	* rebinding of placeholders and NULL values
    Minor fixes:
        * $sth->err gets Solid's native error code. 
       	  Recent versions used to set $xxx->err to -1 independent 
	  of the error returned by Solid.
	* SELECT statements not longer require a finish() between 
	  execute() of the same sth.
        * All binary columns (including BINARY and VARBINARY
	  types) may be used from perl in a transparent fashion.
        * ping() not raising error even if RaiseError is set.
        * DBD::Solid::Const not longer used inside Solid.pm 
	  due to problems with mod_perl/embperl. SQL type values 
	  are included in recent DBI modules.
	* tests use now DBI_DSN/DBI_USER/DBI_PASS env vars.
	* Column names of arbitrary length are possible now (although
	  there is most likely a Solid limit for this).

0.10 Feb 09, 1998
    * added Win32 ($Config{ostype} == 'MSWin32') to Makefile.PL
    * added freebsd to Makefile.PL (thanks to Tom)
    * fixed ping() method for Solid's unix pipe connections 
    	(thanks to Tom Moertel)

0.09 Nov 20, 1997
    * added support for InactiveDestroy (as suggested by tim)
    * added ping() method.
    * added irix to Makefile.PL (and a note in the README) 
    * Autocommit relies (again) on the corresponding database
      function.

0.08
    Bugfixes:
        * fixed memory leak in $sth DESTROY function (thanks, Tim)
	* fixed LINKTYPE=static in Makefile.PL
    DBI changes:
	* added $h->{LongReadLen} and $h->{LongTruncOk} for DBI-0.86
	  [ was already there as solid_blob_size ] 
	* solid_blob_size now prints warning when used (the 
		preferred attribute is LongReadLen as specified by DBI.)
        * README: added statement about DBD::ODBC, linking problems
        * changed error handling for fetchrow_array() and read_blob(),
	  so that nothing prints when $h->{PrintError} is active.
	* $h->err is _only_ set when really an error occured; conditions
	  like SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND and SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO only
	  set $h->err when they are not expected.
        * Like the fetchrow_xxx() functions, the blob_read() function
	  now returns undef to indicate that all data was fetched from a
	  field.

0.07   Sun Jun 08 20:14:01 MET DST 1997
    Bugfixes:
	* bind_columns now works immediate after prepare().
	* AutoCommit handled by driver,
	  rollback/commit at disconnect() depends on AutoCommit value.
	  This works around a Solid database bug.
          
    Enhancements:
	* The write/only attribute $dbh->{solid_characterset} may be
	  used to activate Solid's character set translation features.
	* Makefile.PL knows about more operating systems:
		linux SCO3.2 hpux irix solaris
	* changed function names so DBD::Oracle and DBD::Solid may
	  coexist in a static perl binary
	* $dbh->{AutoCommit} is now ON by default (to comply 
	  to DBI spec)
        * links dynamic by default
        * $sth->execute() returns the row count [the same value
          like $h->rows(), so returns -1 after executing a select]
        * $sth->rows() counts the rows actually fetched from the
          database.
    INCOMPATIBILITIES:
	* It's not longer possible to set the size of the buffer 
	  used to fetch LONG columns using the $sth->{blob_size} syntax.
	  You may use either the solid_blob_size attribute to prepare()
	  or the blob_read function.
	* After fetching all rows, $sth->err becomes zero instead 
	  of +100 to suppress weird messages from $h->{PrintError} 
	  at end of each fetch.

0.06   Tue May 31 1997
	* Bugfix for perl 5.003: testenv.pm now uses Exporter.

0.05   Sat May 10 03:24:12 MET DST 1997
	* truncate of LONG fields is now working
	* some minor bugs, especially tests, are fixed
	* error handling complies to the DBI draft
	  ($h->err, $h->errstr and $h->state should be full functional)
	* Makefile.PL is now a bit more intelligent
	* Tested with Perl5.003_95 and DBI-0.81

0.04   
	- The 0.03 test problem is FIXED.
       	- Bugfix fetchrow(): returns truncated LONG VARCHAR columns now 
       		with the truncated size, not padded with random 
		memory contents.
       	- Bugfix fetchrow(): TIMESTAMP values are now converted to 
       		ascii without forgetting the time value. This is
		done using sprintf(). 
		No way with implicit TIMESTAMP=>C_CHAR conversion (???)
       	- Makefile.PL: 
       		added Solid-2.2 filenames.
		added [experimental] shared linking with static
			Solid libraries.
       	- blob_read() works! - at least with Solid-2.2.
