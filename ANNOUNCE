Everyone, 

I've put together a new release of DBD::Solid, a DBD module written by 
Thomas Wenrich to access the Solid Embedded Engine.

Tim Bunce's DBI module is *the* standard way to access a number of 
different databases from perl.  FYI, DBD::Solid is a driver code that enables
 Perl 5.003 and 5.004 to access the Solid RDBMS via the DBI module 
(you will need the code for the latest release of DBI and DBD::Solid).

Since there hasn't been much interest by anyone else in keeping it up to
date, and we've already made a number of changes to keep it working, we 
thought it would be nice to release our changes as a new version.  In the
future we'll do our best to try to fix problems/update it as quick as
possible.

Have Fun,

Joe & Everyone at Geospiza
